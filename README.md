# House-Sale-Price-Prediction

This Project is to find the Price of a House that has been sale. They are 81 Columns present in the Data Set. Years of the Houses are available from 1880. Project containing information of train.csv, data_description.txt. Project is about House Prices (Kaggle Competition One). It is having 1403 rows and 81 columns. It is a Structured Data Set.

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this Project challenges us to predict the final price of each home. 
It is all about to Predict a Sale Price of a House which can be a new one (or) old one. For buying a new house they are different types of aspects that are being included. Those all things are included in this Project. 
For this, Project I am going to apply two different Pre-Processing Techniques. And creating models for the Data Set. After creating models for Data sets applying Algorithms according to it. 

The following are the objectives of this project:
•	The main objective is to find the Sale Price of a House
•	Applying Advanced Regression Algorithms 
•	Create graphs (or) charts for understanding the how sale price is being increased
